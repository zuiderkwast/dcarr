/*********************************************************************
 * dcarr.h - A generic dynamic array implemented as macros.          *
 *                                                                   *
 * The array uses a circular buffer, thus it has amortized constant  *
 * time insertion/removal at both ends. It is therefore well suited  *
 * for FIFO queues and deques, and as a general purpose dynamic      *
 * array. This implementation is also know as a deque array.         *
 *                                                                   *
 * The memory overhead is 3 * sizeof(int) + n * sizeof(valuetype)    *
 * where 0 <= n <= N / 2, and N is the number of elements.           *
 *                                                                   *
 * Compared to a basic dynamic array, it only stores one extra       *
 * integer: an internal offset.                                      *
